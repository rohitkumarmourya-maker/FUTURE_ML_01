Spotify Mood Classification:  This project aims to classify songs into different moods (e.g., happy, sad, energetic, calm) using machine learning techniques. By analyzing audio features from the Spotify Song Dataset, the model predicts the mood of a song and visualizes mood distributions across playlists.
